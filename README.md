![Dark Theme Support](/public/assets/images/preview3.png)

#### Codeforces Lite offers a highly optimized dark theme designed to provide a more visually comfortable experience, especially during extended coding sessions. The dark theme ensures a consistent look throughout the entire platform.

#### Key features of the dark theme include:

- **Eye Comfort:** The dark theme reduces eye strain by minimizing the contrast between the screen and the environment, particularly in low-light conditions.
- **Battery Efficiency:** On devices with OLED or AMOLED screens, the dark theme can help conserve battery life by reducing the energy used to display brighter pixels.
- **Code Readability:** Syntax highlighting is optimized for better readability in dark mode, ensuring that different elements in the code—such as keywords, variables, and comments—stand out clearly without causing visual fatigue.
- **User Control:** You can toggle the dark theme on or off based on your preferences, allowing you to switch between light and dark modes seamlessly.

## 5. Customizable Keyboard Shortcuts

Tailor your coding workflow with customizable keyboard shortcuts. Codeforces Lite allows you to assign your preferred key combinations for essential actions, reducing mouse dependency and speeding up your CP.

- **Configurable Actions**: Set custom shortcuts for:
  - **Run Code**: Execute your code against test cases.
  - **Submit Code**: Submit your solution.
  - **Reset Code**: Clear the editor back to the default template.
  - **Format Code**: Apply language-specific formatting.
- **Easy Configuration**: Access all shortcut settings in a dedicated panel within the extension's options.
- **Dynamic Tooltips**: Button tooltips automatically update to reflect your custom shortcuts, helping you learn and remember them.

## 6. Custom Templates and Default Cursor Placement

#### With Codeforces Lite, you can set up custom templates that automatically load whenever you start solving a new problem. This feature helps you avoid the repetitive task of setting up your environment or writing boilerplate code from scratch.

#### By predefining your commonly used template (such as input/output functions, imports, or debugging statements), you can focus directly on problem-solving, improving your speed and efficiency during contests or practice sessions.

#### Additionally, you can specify the exact position for your cursor using the `$0` symbol in your template, allowing you to start typing right where you need. The extension also remembers the cursor's position when switching tabs and revisiting problems, ensuring you pick up exactly where you left off—saving valuable time during contests.

## 7. UI Enhancements
